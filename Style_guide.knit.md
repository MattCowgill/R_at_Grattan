# Grattan coding style {#coding-style}



The benefits of a common coding style are well explained [by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html):

> Good style is important because while your code only has one author, itâ€™ll usually have multiple readers. This is especially true when youâ€™re writing code with others. In that case, itâ€™s a good idea to agree on a common style up-front.

Below we describe the **key** elements of Grattan coding style, without being too tedious about it all. There are many elements of coding style we don't cover in this guide; if you're unsure about anything, [consult the `tidyverse` guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). 

You should also see the [Using R at Grattan](#organising-projects) page for guidelines about setting up projects.

## Script preamble

Describe what your script does in the first few lines using comments or within an RMarkdown document.

**Good**

```r
# This script reads ABS data downloaded from TableBuilder and combines into a single data object containing post-secondary education levels by age and gender by SA3. 
```

Your preamble might also pose a research question that the script will answer.

**Good**

```r
# Do women have higher levels of educational attainment than men, within the same geographical areas and age groups?
```

Your preamble shouldn't be a terse, inscrutable comment.

**Bad**

```r
# make ABS ed data graph
```

If it's hard to concisely describe what your script does in a few lines of plain English, that might be a sign that your script does too many things. Consider breaking your analysis into a series of scripts. See [Organising R Projects at Grattan](#organising-projects) for more.

Your preamble should anticipate and answer any questions other people might have when reviewing your script. For example:

**Good**

```r
# This script calculates average income by age group and sex using the ABS Household Expenditure Survey and joins this to health information by age groups and sex from the National Health Survey. Note that we can't use the income variable in the NHS for this purpose, as it only contains information about respondents' income decile, not the income itself.
```

The preamble should pertain the the code contained in the specific script. If you have comments or information about your analysis as a whole, put it in your [README file](#README).

## Use comments {#use-comments}

Comments are necessary where the code _alone_ doesn't tell the full story. Comments should tell the reader **why** you're doing something, rather than just **what** you're doing. 

For example, comments are important when groups are coded with numbers rather than character strings, because this might not be obvious to someone reading your script:

**Necessary to comment**

```r
data %>% 
  filter(gender == 1,   # Keep only male observations
         age == "05")   # Keep only 35-39 year-olds. 
```

Without the comment, readers of your code might not be aware that `1` in this dataset corresponds to `male`, or that `age == "05"` refers to 35-39 year olds. Without the comment, the code is not self-explanatory.

If your code _is_ self-explanatory, you can include or omit comments as you see fit.

**Not necessary (but okay if included)**

```r
# We want to only look at women aged 35-39
data %>% 
  filter(gender == "Female",
         age >= 35 & age <= 39)
```

You should also include comments where your code is more complex and may not be easily understood by the reader. If you're using a function from a package that isn't commonly used at Grattan, include a comment to explain what it does.

_Err on the side of commenting more_, rather than less, throughout your code. Something may seem obvious to you when you're writing your code, but it might not be obvious to the person reading your code, even if that person is you in the future. Better to over-comment than under-comment.

Comments can go above code chunks, or next to code - there are examples of both above. 

## Breaking your script into chunks

It's useful to break a lengthy script into chunks with `-----`.
