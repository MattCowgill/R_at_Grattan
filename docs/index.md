# Welcome {-}

This guide is designed for everyone who uses - or would like to use - R at Grattan Institute. 

It does two main things:

1. Sets out some guidelines and good practices when using R at Grattan.
2. Shows you how to use R to the sort of analytical tasks you're likely to undertake at Grattan.

As a guide to using R, this website is helpful but incomplete. We can't possibly cover - or anticipate - all the skills you might need to know. If you make it to the end of this guide and want to learn more, start by reading [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It's free.

Any complaints or comments about this guide can be sent to Will or Matt, respectively. 

This site was written in R with RMarkdown and the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) package.
