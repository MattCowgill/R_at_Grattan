["index.html", "Using R at Grattan Institute Welcome", " Using R at Grattan Institute Will Mackey and Matt Cowgill 2019-09-10 Welcome This guide is designed for everyone who uses - or would like to use - R at Grattan Institute. It does two main things: 1. Shows you how to use R to complete common analytical tasks you’ll face at Grattan. 2. Sets out some guidelines and good practices when using R at Grattan. As a guide to using R, this website is helpful but incomplete. We can’t possibly cover - or anticipate - all the skills you might need to know. If you make it to the end of this guide and want to learn more, start by reading R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It’s free. Any complaints or comments about this guide can be sent to Will or Matt, respectively. This site was written in R with RMarkdown and the bookdown package. "],
["introduction-to-r.html", "1 Introduction to R 1.1 What is R? 1.2 What is RStudio? 1.3 Installing R and RStudio 1.4 Packages", " 1 Introduction to R Most people reading this guide will know what R is. But if you don’t - that’s OK! If you have used R before and are comfortable enough with it, you might want to skip to the next page. This page is intended for people who are unfamiliar with R. 1.1 What is R? R is a programming language that is designed by and for statisticians, data scientists, and other people who work with data. It’s free - you can download R at no charge. It’s also open source - you can view and (if you’re game) modify the code that underlies the R language. R is available for all major computing platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. R has a lot in common with other statistical software like SAS, Stata, SPSS or Eviews. You can use those software packages to read data, manipulate it, generate summary statistics, estimate models, and so on. You can use R for all those things and more. You interact with R by writing code. This is a little different to Stata or SPSS, which allow you to do at least part of your analyses by clicking on menus and buttons. This means the initial learning curve for R can be a little steeper than for something like SPSS, but there are great benefits to a code-based approach to data analysis (see the next page for more on this). R also has a fair bit of overlap with general purpose programming languages like Python. But R is more focused on the sort of tasks that statisticians, data scientists, and academic researchers do. R is quite old, having been first released publicly in 1995, but it’s also growing and changing rapidly. A lot of developments in R come in the form of new add-on pieces of software - known as ‘packages’ - that extend R’s functionality in some way. We cover packages more later in this page. When you open R itself, you’re confronted with a few disclaimers and a command prompt, similar in appearance to the Terminal on macOS or command prompt in Windows. This might look a bit intimidating, but you’ll almost never open R directly and interact with it in that way. To analyse data with R, you will typically write out a text file containing code. This file - which we’ll call a script - should be able to be read and executed by R from start to finish. The easiest way to write your code, run your script, and generate your outputs (whether that’s a chart, a document, or a set of model results) is to use RStudio. 1.2 What is RStudio? RStudio is another piece of free software you can download and run on your computer.1 Like R itself, RStudio is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. In programmer jargon, RStudio is an “integrated development environment” or IDE. Translated to English, this means RStudio has a range of tools that help you work with R. It has a text editor for you to write R scripts, an R ‘console’ to interact directly with the language, and panes that let you see the objects you have stored in memory and any graphs you’ve created, among other things. You’ll almost always interact with R by opening RStudio. 1.3 Installing R and RStudio Although you’ll usually work with R by opening RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio separately. Install R by going to CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. CRAN is a community-run website that houses R itself as well as a broad range of R packages. You want to download the latest base R release, as a ‘binary’. Don’t worry, you don’t need to know what a binary is. For macOS, the page will look like this: For Windows, you’ll need to click on the ‘base’ version, and then click again to start the download. Once you’ve installed R, you’ll need to install RStudio. Go to the RStudio website and install the latest version of RStudio Desktop (open source license). Once they’re both installed, get started by opening RStudio. 1.4 Packages R comes with a lot of functions - commands - built in to do a broad range of tasks. You could, if you really wanted, import a dataset, clean it up, estimate a model, and make a plot all using the functions that come with R - known as ‘base R’2. But a lot of our work at Grattan uses add-on software to base R, known as ‘packages’. Some packages, like the popular ‘dplyr’, make it quicker and/or easier to do tasks that you could otherwise do in base R. Other packages expand the possibilities of what R can do - like fitting a machine learning model, for example. Like R itself, packages are free and open source. You can install them from within RStudio. At Grattan, we make heavy use of a set of related packages known collectively as the tidyverse. We’ll cover this more in a later chapter. 1.4.1 Installing packages You’ll typically install packages using the console in RStudio. That’s the part of the window that, by default, sits in the bottom-left corner of the screen. In our work at Grattan, we use packages from two different source: CRAN and Github. The main difference you need to know about is that we use different commands to install packages from these two sources. To install a package from CRAN, we use the command install.packages(). For example, this code will install the ggplot2 package from CRAN: install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) The easiest way to install a package from Github is to use the function install_github(). Unfortunately, this function doesn’t come with base R. The install_github() function is part of the remotes package. To use it, we first need to install remotes from CRAN: install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) Now we can install packages from Github using the install_github() function from the remotes package. For example, here’s how we would install the Grattan ggplot2 theme, which we’ll discuss later in this website: remotes::install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;, dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = &quot;always&quot;) 1.4.2 Using packages Before using a function that comes from a package, as opposed to base R, you need to tell R where to look for the function. There are two main ways to do that. We can either load (aka ‘attach’) the package by using the library() function. We typically do this at the top of a script. library(remotes) # Now that the `remotes` package is loaded, we can use its `install_github()` function: install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;) Or, we can use two colons - :: - to tell R to use an individual function from a package without loading it: remotes::install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;) It usually makes sense to load a package with library(), unless you only need to use one of its function once or twice. There’s no harm to using the :: operator even if you have already loaded a package with library(). This can remove ambiguity both for R and for humans reading your code, particularly if you’re using an obscure function - it makes it clearer where the function comes from. "],
["why-use-r.html", "2 Why use R? 2.1 Why use script-based software? 2.2 Why use R specifically?", " 2 Why use R? We can break this question into two parts: Why use script-based software to analyse data? Why use R, specifically? 2.1 Why use script-based software? It’s important for our analyses to be reproducible. This means that all of the steps that were taken to go from your raw data to your final outputs are clearly set out and can be reproduced if necessary. Reproducibility is very important for QC, particularly of complex analyses - if it’s not clear what you’ve done, it’s hard for someone to check your work. It also makes things easier for you in the future - coming back to an old analysis a few months or years down the track is much easier if it’s reproducible. Script-based analyses are more likely to be reproducible.3 A script sets out all the steps that were taken from reading in data, to tidying it, to estimating models or summary statistics and generating output. Analysis that isn’t script based, like work done in Excel, is not reproducible. It is never clear what steps were taken, in which order, to go from the raw data to the output. It isn’t even always clear in a spreadsheet what is the ‘raw data’ and what has been modified in some way. Using scripts makes us less susceptible to the sort of errors famously made by the economists Reinhart and Rogoff in their Excel-based analysis of the effect of public debt on economic growth. It’s still possible to make errors in a script-based analysis, but those errors are easier to find when the analysis is more transparent. Script-based analysis software also allows us to: * Work with larger data sets; * Work with data in a broader range of formats; * Easily combine different data sets; * Automate tasks and build from previous analyses; and * Estimate statistical models. 2.2 Why use R specifically? Doing reproducible, script-based, research doesn’t necessarily involve using R. It’s perfectly possible to do reproducible work in Stata or Python (though harder in SPSS, where data is primarily manipulated by clicking things). We use R specifically because: * It’s free! * It’s open source. * It’s powerful. * It’s flexible. * It has an active community extending its capabilities all the time and providing support online. * It is becoming the norm in academic research and common in the corporate world. Everything you can do in Excel can be done in R. "],

["organising-an-r-project-at-grttan.html", "5 Organising an R project at Grttan 5.1 Use RStudio projects, not setwd() 5.2 Keep your stuff together 5.3 Include a README file 5.4 Use relative filepaths 5.5 Keep your scripts manageable", " 5 Organising an R project at Grttan All our work, in R or otherwise, should heed the “hit by a bus” rule - if you’re not around, colleagues should be able to access, understand, verify, and build on the work you’ve done. Organising your analysis in a predictable, consistent way helps to make your work reproducible by others, including yourself in the future. This is really important! If your analysis is messy, you’re more likely to make errors, and less likely to spot them. Other people will find it hard to check your analysis and you’ll find it harder to return to it down the track. This page sets out some guidelines for organising your work in R at Grattan. It covers: Using RStudio projects and relative filepaths Using a consistent subfolder structure Naming your scripts and keeping them manageable Coding style at Grattan 5.1 Use RStudio projects, not setwd() You’ll almost always be reading and/or writing files to disk as part of your analysis in R. To do this, R needs to know where to read files from and save files to. By default, it uses your working directory. One way to tell R which folder to use as your working directory is using the command setwd(), like setwd(\"~/Desktop/some random folder\") or setwd(\"C:\\Users\\mcowgill\\Documents\\Somerandomfolder\"). This is a bad idea! If anyone - including you - tries to run your script on a different machine, with a different folder structure, it probably won’t work. If people can’t get past the first line when they’re trying to run your script, there’s an annoying and unnecessary hurdle to reproducing and checking your analysis. In the words of Jenny Bryan: if the first line of your R script is setwd(\"C:\\Users\\jenny\\path\\that\\only\\I\\have\") I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE. Seems fair. Creating a ‘project’ in RStudio sets your working directory in a way that’s portable across machines. Creating an RStudio project is straightforward: click File, then New Project. You can then choose to start your project in a new directory, or an existing directory. Simple! RStudio will then create a file with an .Rproj extension in the folder you’ve chosen. When you want to work in this project, just open the .Rproj file, or click File -&gt; Open project in RStudio. Your working directory will be set to the directory that contains the .Rproj file. 5.2 Keep your stuff together Your script(s), data, and output should generally all live in the same place.4 That place should be the folder that contains the .Rproj file that was created when you created an RStudio project, and subfolders of that folder. Don’t just put everything in your project folder itself. This can get really overwhelming and confusing, particularly for anyone trying to understand and check your work. Instead, separate your code, your source data, and your output into subfolders. A good structure is to have a subfolder for: your code - called ‘R’ or ‘code’. your source data - called ‘data’ your graphs - called ‘graphs’ or ‘figs’ or ‘atlas’, like in LaTeX your non-graph output, like formatted tables, called ‘output’ or ‘tables’ Sometimes your data folder might have subfolders - ‘raw’ for data that you’ve done nothing to, and ‘clean’ for data you’ve modified in some way. 5.3 Include a README file Your analysis workflow might seem completely obvious to you. Let’s say that in one script you load raw ABS microdata, run a particular script to clean it up, save the cleaned data somewhere, then load that cleaned data in a second script to produce a summary table, then use a third script to produce a graph based on the summary table. Easy! Except that might not seem easy or self-explanatory to anyone who comes along and tries to figure out how your analysis works, including you in the future. Make things easier by including a short text file - called README - in the project folder. This should explain the purpose of the project, the key files, and (if it isn’t clear) the order in which they should be run. 5.4 Use relative filepaths When you read or write files with R, don’t use filepaths that are specific to your machine. Bad hes &lt;- read_csv(&quot;/Users/mcowgill/Desktop/hes1516.csv&quot;) hes &lt;- read_csb(&quot;C:\\Users\\mcowgill\\Desktop\\hes1516.csv&quot;) grattan_save(&quot;/Users/mcowgill/Desktop/images/expenditure_by_income.pdf&quot;) Instead, use relative filepaths. These are filepaths that are relative (hence the name) to your project folder, which you set by creating an RStudio project. Good hes &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/HES/hes1516.csv&quot;) grattan_save(&quot;images/expenditure_by_income.pdf&quot;) The first example above tells R to look in the ‘data’ subdirectory of your project folder, and then the ‘HES’ subdirectory of ‘data’, to find the ‘hes1516.csv’ file. This file path isn’t specific to your machine, so your code is more shareable this way. 5.5 Keep your scripts manageable Unless your project is very simple, it’s probably not a good idea to put all your work into one R script. Instead, break your analysis into discrete pieces and put each piece in its own file. Number the files to make it clear what order they’re supposed to be run in. Here’s a useful structure: 01_import.R 02_tidy.R 03_model.R 04_visualise.R It should be clear what each script is trying to do. Use comments! Don’t retain code that ultimately didn’t lead anywhere. If you produced a graph that ended up not being used, don’t keep the code in your script - if you want to save it, move it to a subfolder named ‘archive’ or similar. Your code should include the steps needed to go from your raw data to your output - and not extraneous steps. Don’t include interactive work (like View(mydf), str(mydf), mean(mydf$variable), etc.) in your saved script. These type of commands should usually be entered straight into the R console, not in a script. Each script should generally do one main thing. If you’re producing five charts, you should generally have five separate chart scripts. "],

Both of these packages are loaded with tidyverse. The scales package helps with labelling your axes. The grattantheme package is used to make charts look Grattan-y. The absmapsdata package is used to help make maps. library(tidyverse) library(grattantheme) library(absmapsdata) library(sf) library(scales) For most charts in this chapter, we’ll use the population_table data summarised here. It contains the population in each state between 2013 and 2018: population_table &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/population_sa4.csv&quot;) %&gt;% filter(data_item == &quot;Persons - Total (no.)&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(pop = as.numeric(value), year = as.factor(year)) %&gt;% group_by(year, state) %&gt;% summarise(pop = sum(pop)) # Show the first six rows of the new dataset head(population_table) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## # Groups: year [1] ## year state pop ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2013 Australian Capital Territory 383257 ## 2 2013 New South Wales 7404032 ## 3 2013 Northern Territory 241722 ## 4 2013 Other Territories 2962 ## 5 2013 Queensland 4652824 ## 6 2013 South Australia 1671488 6.2 Concepts The ggplot2 package is based on the grammar of graphics. … The main ingredients to a ggplot chart: Data: what data should be plotted. e.g. data Aesthetics: what variables should be linked to what chart elements. e.g. aes(x = population, y = age) to connect the population variable to the x axis, and the age variable to the y axis. Geoms: how the data should be plotted. e.g. geom_point() will produce a scatter plot, geom_col will produce a column chart. Each plot you make will be made up of these three elements. The full list of standard geoms is listed in the tidyverse documentation. ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;( mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;), stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, position = &lt;POSITION&gt; ) + &lt;COORDINATE_FUNCTION&gt; + &lt;FACET_FUNCTION&gt; For example, you can plot a column chart by passing the population_table dataset into ggplot() (“make a chart wth this data”). This produces an empty plot: population_table %&gt;% ggplot() Next, set the aes (aesthetics) to x = state (“make the x-axis represent state”), y = pop (“the y-axis should represent population”), and fill = year (“the fill colour represents year”). Now ggplot knows where things should go:{r empty with aes} population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = pop, fill = year)) Now that ggplot knows where things should go, it needs to how to plot them. For this we use geoms. Tell it to plot a column chart by using geom_col: population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = pop, fill = year)) + geom_col() Great! Although stacking populations is a bit silly. You can adjust the way geoms work with arguments. In this case, tell it to place the different categories next to each other rather than ontop of each other using position = \"dodge\": population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = pop, fill = year)) + geom_col(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) That’s nicer. The following sections in this chapter will build on this chart. The rest of the chapter will explore: Grattanising your charts and choosing colours Saving charts according to Grattan templates Making bar, line, scatter and distribution plots Making maps and interactive charts Adding chart labels 6.3 Making Grattan-y charts The grattantheme package contains functions that help Grattanise your charts. It is hosted here: https://github.com/mattcowgill/grattantheme You can install it with devtools::install_github from the package: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;) The key functions of grattantheme are: theme_grattan: set size, font and colour defaults that adhere to the Grattan style guide. grattan_y_continuous: sets the right defaults for a continuous y-axis. grattan_colour_continuous: pulls colours from the Grattan colour palete for colour aesthetics. grattan_fill_continuous: pulls colours from the Grattan colour palete for fill aesthetics. grattan_save: a save function that exports charts in correct report or presentation dimensions. This section will run through some examples of Grattanising charts. The ggplot functions are explored in more detail in the next section. 6.3.1 Making Grattan charts Start with a column chart, similar to the one made above: base_chart &lt;- population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = pop, fill = year)) + geom_col(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, title = &quot;NSW and Victoria are booming&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Population by state, 2013-2018&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: ABS Regional Dataset (2019)&quot;) base_chart Let’s make it Grattany. First, add theme_grattan to your plot: base_chart + theme_grattan() Then grattan_y_continuous to align the x-axis with zero. This function takes the same arguments as scale_y_continuous, so you can add labels = comma() to reformat the y-axis labels: base_chart + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) To define fill colours, use grattan_fill_manual with the number of colours you need (six, in this case): pop_chart &lt;- base_chart + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_fill_manual(6) pop_chart Nice chart! Now you can save it and share it with the world. 6.3.2 Saving Grattan charts The grattan_save function saves your charts according to Grattan templates. It takes these arguments: filename: the path, name and file-type of your saved chart. eg: \"atlas/population_chart.pdf\". object: the R object that you want to save. eg: pop_chart. If left blank, it grabs the last chart that was displayed. type: the Grattan template to be used. This is one of: \"normal\" The default. Use for normal Grattan report charts, or to paste into a 4:3 Powerpoint slide. Width: 22.2cm, height: 14.5cm. \"normal_169\" Only useful for pasting into a 16:9 format Grattan Powerpoint slide. Width: 30cm, height: 14.5cm. \"tiny\" Fills the width of a column in a Grattan report, but is shorter than usual. Width: 22.2cm, height: 11.1cm. \"wholecolumn\" Takes up a whole column in a Grattan report. Width: 22.2cm, height: 22.2cm. \"fullpage\" Fills a whole page of a Grattan report. Width: 44.3cm, height: 22.2cm. \"fullslide\" Creates an image that looks like a 4:3 Grattan Powerpoint slide, complete with logo. Width: 25.4cm, height: 19.0cm. \"fullslide_169\" Creates` an image that looks like a 16:9 Grattan Powerpoint slide, complete with logo. Use this to drop into standard presentations. Width: 33.9cm, height: 19.0cm \"blog\" Creates a 4:3 image that looks like a Grattan Powerpoint slide, but with less border whitespace than ‘fullslide’.\" \"fullslide_44\" Creates an image that looks like a 4:4 Grattan Powerpoint slide. This may be useful for taller charts for the Grattan blog; not useful for any other purpose. Width: 25.4cm, height: 25.4cm. Set type = \"all\" to save your chart in all available sizes. height: override the height set by type. This can be useful for really long charts in blogposts. save_data: exports a csv file containing the data used in the chart. force_labs: override the removal of labels for a particular type. eg force_labs = TRUE will keep the y-axis label. To save the pop_chart plot created above as a whole-column chart for a report: grattan_save(&quot;atlas/population_chart_report.pdf&quot;, pop_chart, type = &quot;wholecolumn&quot;) To save it as a presentation slide instead, use type = \"fullslide\": grattan_save(&quot;atlas/population_chart_presentation.pdf&quot;, pop_chart, type = &quot;fullslide&quot;) Or, if you want to emphasise the point in a really tall chart for a blogpost, you can use type = \"blog\" and adjust the height to be 50cm. Also note that because this is for the blog, you should save it as a png file: grattan_save(&quot;atlas/population_chart_blog.png&quot;, pop_chart, type = &quot;blog&quot;, height = 50) And that’s it! The following sections will go into more detail about different chart types in R, but you’ll mostly use the same basic grattantheme formatting you’ve used here. 6.4 Chart cookbook This section takes you through a few often-used chart types. 6.4.1 Bar charts Bar charts are made with geom_bar or geom_col. Creating a bar chart will look something like this: ggplot(data = &lt;data&gt;) + geom_bar(aes(x = &lt;xvar&gt;, y = &lt;yvar&gt;), stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, position = &lt;POSITION&gt; ) It has two key arguments: stat and position. First, stat defines what kind of operation the function will do on the dataset before plotting. Some options are: \"count\", the default: count the number of observations in a particular group, and plot that number. This is useful when you’re using microdata. When this is the case, there is no need for a y aesthetic. \"sum\": sum the values of the y aesthetic. \"identity\": directly report the values of the y aesthetic. This is how Powerpoint and Excel charts work. You can use geom_col instead, as a shortcut for geom_bar(stat = \"identity). Second, position, dictates how multiple bars occupying the same x-axis position will positioned. The options are: \"stack\", the default: bars in the same group are stacked atop one another. \"dodge\": bars in the same group are positioned next to one another. \"fill\": bars in the same group are stacked and all fill to 100 per cent. population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = pop, fill = year)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_fill_manual(6) You can also order the groups in your chart by a variable. If you want to order states by population, use reorder inside aes: population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, -pop), # reorder state by negative population y = pop, fill = year)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_fill_manual(6) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) To flip the chart – a useful move when you have long labels – add coord_flipped (ie ‘flip coordinates’) and tell theme_grattan that the plot is flipped using flipped = TRUE. population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, -pop), y = pop, fill = year)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + coord_flip() + # flip the coordinates theme_grattan(flipped = TRUE) + # tell theme_grattan grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_fill_manual(6) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) 6.4.2 Line charts A line chart has one key aesthetic: group. This tells ggplot how to connect individual lines. population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pop, colour = state, group = state)) + geom_line() + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_colour_manual(9) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) ## Warning in grattantheme::grattan_pal(n = n, reverse = reverse, faded = ## faded): Using more than six colours is not recommended. You can also add dots for each year by layering geom_point on top of geom_line: population_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pop, colour = state, group = state)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 2) + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_colour_manual(9) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) ## Warning in grattantheme::grattan_pal(n = n, reverse = reverse, faded = ## faded): Using more than six colours is not recommended. If you wanted to show each state individually, you could facet your chart so that a separate plot was produced for each state: population_table %&gt;% filter(state != &quot;ACT&quot;, state != &quot;NT&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pop, group = state)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 2) + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous() + facet_wrap(state ~ .) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) To tidy this up, we can: shorten the years to be “13”, “14”, etc instead of “2013”, “2014”, etc (via the x aesthetic) shorten the y-axis labels to “millions” (via the y aesthetic) add a black horizontal line at the bottom of each facet give the facets a bit of room by adjusting panel.spacing define our own x-axis label breaks to just show 13, 15 and 17 population_table %&gt;% filter(state != &quot;ACT&quot;, state != &quot;NT&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = substr(year, 3, 4), # 1: just take the last two characters y = pop / 1e6, # 2: divide population by one million group = state)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + # 3: add horizontal line at the bottom theme_grattan() + theme(panel.spacing = unit(10, &quot;mm&quot;)) + # 4: add panel spacing grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(&quot;13&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;17&quot;)) + # 5: define our own label breaks facet_wrap(state ~ .) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) 6.4.3 Scatter plots Scatter plots require x and y aesthetics. These can then be coloured and facetted. First, create a dataset that we’ll use for scatter plots. Take the population_table dataset and transform it to have one variable for population in 2013, and another for population in 2018: population_diff &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/population_sa4.csv&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(state_long = state, state = strayr::strayr(state_long), pop = as.numeric(value), year = as.factor(glue::glue(&quot;y{year}&quot;))) %&gt;% filter(year %in% c(&quot;y2013&quot;, &quot;y2018&quot;), data_item == &quot;Persons - Total (no.)&quot;, sa4_name != &quot;Other Territories&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(year, state, sa4_name) %&gt;% summarise(pop = sum(pop)) %&gt;% spread(year, pop) %&gt;% mutate(pop_change = 100 * (y2018 / y2013 - 1)) population_diff %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = y2013/1000, y = pop_change)) + geom_point(size = 4) + theme_grattan() + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90)) + grattan_y_continuous() + labs(y = &quot;Population increase to 2018, per cent&quot;, x = &quot;Population in 2013, thousands&quot;) It looks like the areas with the largest population grew the most between 2013 and 2018. To explore the relationship further, you can add a line-of-best-fit with geom_smooth: population_diff %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = y2013/1000, # display the x-axis as thousands y = pop_change)) + geom_point(size = 4) + geom_smooth() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + theme_grattan() + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90)) + grattan_y_continuous() + labs(y = &quot;Population increase to 2018, per cent&quot;, x = &quot;Population in 2013, thousands&quot;) You could colour-code positive and negative changes from within the geom_point aesthetic. Making a change there won’t pass through to the geom_smooth aesthetic, so your line-of-best-fit will apply to all data points. population_diff %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = y2013/1000, # display the x-axis as thousands y = pop_change)) + geom_point(aes(colour = pop_change &lt; 0), size = 4) + geom_smooth() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + theme_grattan() + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90)) + grattan_y_continuous() + grattan_colour_manual(2) + labs(y = &quot;Population increase to 2018, per cent&quot;, x = &quot;Population in 2013, thousands&quot;) Like the charts above, you could facet this by state to see if there were any interesting patterns. We’ll filter out ACT and NT because they only have one and two data points (SA4s) in them, respectively. population_diff %&gt;% filter(state != &quot;ACT&quot;, state != &quot;NT&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = y2013/1000, # display the x-axis as thousands y = pop_change)) + geom_point(aes(colour = pop_change &lt; 0), size = 2) + geom_smooth() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + theme_grattan() + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90)) + grattan_y_continuous() + grattan_colour_manual(2) + labs(y = &quot;Population increase to 2018, per cent&quot;, x = &quot;Population in 2013, thousands&quot;) + facet_wrap(state ~ .) 6.4.4 Distributions geom_histogram geom_density ggridges:: 6.4.5 Maps 6.4.5.1 sf objects [what is] 6.4.5.2 Using absmapsdata The absmapsdata contains compressed, and tidied sf objects containing geometric information about ABS data structures.

You will also need the sf package installed to handle the sf objects. devtools::install_github(&quot;wfmackey/absmapsdata&quot;) library(absmapsdata) install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) library(sf) 6.4.5.3 Making choropleth maps Choropleth maps break an area into ‘bits’, and colours each ‘bit’ according to a variable. SA4 is the largest non-state statistical area in the ABS ASGS standard. You can join the sf objects from absmapsdata to your dataset using left_join. The variable names might be different – eg sa4_name compared to sa4_name_2016 – so use the by function to match them. map_data &lt;- population_diff %&gt;% left_join(sa42016, by = c(&quot;sa4_name&quot; = &quot;sa4_name_2016&quot;)) head(map_data %&gt;% select(sa4_name, geometry)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## # Groups: state [2] ## state sa4_name geometry ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt; ## 1 ACT Australian Capita… (((148.8041 -35.71402, 148.8018 -35.7121, 148.7… ## 2 NSW Capital Region (((150.3113 -35.66588, 150.3126 -35.66814, 150.… ## 3 NSW Central Coast (((151.315 -33.55582, 151.3159 -33.55503, 151.3… ## 4 NSW Central West (((150.6107 -33.06614, 150.6117 -33.07051, 150.… ## 5 NSW Coffs Harbour - G… (((153.2785 -29.91874, 153.2773 -29.92067, 153.… ## 6 NSW Far West and Orana (((150.1106 -31.74613, 150.1103 -31.74892, 150.… You then plot a map like you would any other ggplot: provide your data, choose your aes and your geom.
