As a guide to using R, this website is helpful but incomplete. We can’t possibly cover - or anticipate - all the skills you might need to know. If you make it to the end of this guide and want to learn more, start by reading R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It’s free.

["introduction-to-r.html", "1 Introduction to R 1.1 What is R? 1.2 What is RStudio? 1.3 Installing R and RStudio 1.4 Packages", " 1 Introduction to R Most people reading this guide will know what R is. But if you don’t - that’s OK! If you have used R before and are comfortable enough with it, you might want to skip to the next page. This page is intended for people who are unfamiliar with R. 1.1 What is R? R is a programming language that is designed by and for statisticians, data scientists, and other people who work with data. It’s free - you can download R at no charge. It’s also open source - you can view and (if you’re game) modify the code that underlies the R language. R is available for all major computing platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. R has a lot in common with other statistical software like SAS, Stata, SPSS or Eviews. You can use those software packages to read data, manipulate it, generate summary statistics, estimate models, and so on. You can use R for all those things and more. You interact with R by writing code. This is a little different to Stata or SPSS, which allow you to do at least part of your analyses by clicking on menus and buttons. This means the initial learning curve for R can be a little steeper than for something like SPSS, but there are great benefits to a code-based approach to data analysis (see the next page for more on this). R also has some overlap with general purpose programming languages like Python. But R is more focused on the sort of tasks that statisticians, data scientists, and academic researchers do. R is quite old, having been first released publicly in 1995, but it’s also growing and changing rapidly. A lot of developments in R come in the form of new add-on pieces of software - known as ‘packages’ - that extend R’s functionality in some way. We cover packages more later in this page. When you open R itself, you’re confronted with a few disclaimers and a command prompt, similar in appearance to the Terminal on macOS or command prompt in Windows. This looks a bit intimidating, but you’ll almost never open R directly and interact with it in that way. To analyse data with R, you will typically write out a text file containing your code. This file - which we’ll call a script - should be able to be read and executed by R from start to finish. The easiest way to write your code, run your script, and generate your outputs (whether that’s a chart, a document, or a set of model results) is to use RStudio. 1.2 What is RStudio? RStudio is another piece of free software you can download and run on your computer.1 It’s also available for Windows, macOS and Linux. In programmer jargon, RStudio is an “integrated development environment” or IDE. This means RStudio has a range of tools that help you work with R. It has a text editor for you to write R scripts, an R ‘console’ to interact directly with the language, and panes that let you see the objects you have stored in memory and any graphs you’ve created. You’ll almost always interact with R by opening RStudio. 1.3 Installing R and RStudio Although you’ll usually work with R by opening RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio separately. Install R by going to CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. CRAN is a community-run website that houses R itself as well as a broad range of R packages. You want to download the latest base R release, as a ‘binary’. Don’t worry, you don’t need to know what a binary is. For macOS, the page will look like this: For Windows, you’ll need to click on the ‘base’ version, and then click again to start the download. Once you’ve installed R, you’ll need to install RStudio. Go to the RStudio website and install the latest version of RStudio Desktop (open source license). Once they’re both installed, get started by opening RStudio. 1.4 Packages R comes with a lot of functions - commands - built in to do a broad range of data tasks. You could, if you really wanted, import a dataset, clean it up, estimate a model, and make a plot all using the functions that come with R - known as ‘base R’2. But a lot of our work at Grattan uses add-on software to base R, known as ‘packages’. Some packages, like the popular ‘dplyr’, make it quicker and/or easier to do tasks that you could otherwise do in base R. Other packages expand the possibilities of what R can do - like fitting a machine learning model, for example. Like R itself, packages are free and open source. You can install them from within RStudio. At Grattan, we make heavy use of a set of related packages known collectively as the tidyverse. We’ll cover these more in a later chapter. 1.4.1 Installing packages You’ll typically install packages using the console in RStudio. That’s the part of the window that, by default, sits in the bottom-left corner of the screen. In our work at Grattan, we use packages from two different source: CRAN and Github. The main difference you need to know about is that we use different commands to install packages from these two sources. To install a package from CRAN, we use the command install.packages(). For example, this code will install the ggplot2 package from CRAN: install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) To install a package from Github, we use the function install_github(). Unfortunately, this package doesn’t come with R - it’s part of the devtools package. First, we install devtools from CRAN: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) Now we can install packages from Github using the install_github() function from the devtools package. For example, here’s how we would install the Grattan ggplot2 theme, which we’ll discuss later in this website: devtools::install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) 1.4.2 Using packages Before using a function that comes from a package, as opposed to base R, you need to tell R where to look for the function. There are two main ways to do that. We can either load (aka ‘attach’) the package by using the library() function: library(devtools) # Now that the `devtools` package is loaded, we can use its `install_github()` function: install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;) Or, we can use two colons - :: - to tell R to use an individual function from a package without loading it: devtools::install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;) It usually makes sense to load a package with library(), unless you only need to use one of its function once or twice. There’s no harm to using the :: operator even if you have already loaded a package with library(). This can remove ambiguity both for R and for humans reading your code, particularly if you’re using an obscure function - it makes it clearer where the function comes from. RStudio is, somewhat confusingly, a product made by a company called RStudio. Although the RStudio desktop software is free, RStudio makes money by charging for other services, like running R in the cloud. When we refer to RStudio, we’re referring to the desktop software unless we make it clear that we mean the company.↩ Technically some of the ‘built-in’ functions are part of packages, like the tools, utils and stats packages that come with R. We’ll refer to all these as base R.↩ "],

Finally adhering to the ‘hit by a bus’ rule. Having a clear, consistent structure for our analyses means that our work is more easily checked and revised, including by ourselves in the future. A small investment of time up front to set up your analysis will save time (your own and others’) down the track. Cover: 1. setwd() and machine-speficic filepaths are bad 2. relative file paths are good 3.

It should be clear what your script is trying to do (use comments!). Consider breaking your analysis into pieces. For example: 01_import.R 02_tidy.R 03_model.R 04_visualise.R Don’t include interactive work (like View(mydf), str(mydf), mean(mydf$variable), etc.) in your saved script. 3.1.3 Use subfolders of your project folder Remember the hit-by-a-bus rule. It should be easy for any Grattan colleague to open your project folder and get up to speed with what it does. Putting all your files - raw data, scripts, output - in the one folder makes it harder to understand how your work fits together. Use subfolders to clearly separate your code, raw data, and output. 3.2 Grattan coding style guide Short summary of why Link to style guide 3.3 What is the tidyverse and why do we use it?

["data-visualisation.html", "4 Data Visualisation 4.1 Introduction to data visualisation 4.2 Set-up and packages 4.3 Concepts 4.4 Exploratory data visualisation 4.5 Making Grattan-y charts 4.6 Adding labels", " 4 Data Visualisation This chapter explores data visualisation broadly, and how to ‘do’ data visualisation in R specifically. The next chapter – the Visualisation Cookbook – gives more practical advice for the charts you might want to create. 4.1 Introduction to data visualisation You can use data visualisation to examine and explore your data, and to present a finding to your audience. Both of these elements are important. When you start using a dataset, you should look at it.3 Plot histograms of variables-of-interest to spot outliers. Explore correlations between variables with scatter plots and lines-of-best-fit. Check how many observations are in particular groups with bar charts. Identify variables that have missing or coded-missing values. Use faceting to explore differences in the above between groups, and do it interactively with non-static plots. These exploratory plots are just for you and your team. They don’t need to be perfectly labelled, the right size, in the Grattan palette, or be particularly interesting. They’re built and used only to help you and your team explore the data. Through this process, you can become confident your data is what you think it is. When you choose to present a visualisation to a reader, you have to make decisions about what they can and cannot see. You need to highlight or omit particular things to help them better understand the message you are presenting. This requires important technical decisions: what data to use, what ‘stat’ to present it with — show every data point, show a distribution function, show the average or the median? — and on what scale — raw numbers, on a log scale, as a proportion of a total?. It also requires aesthetic decisions. What colours in the Grattan palette would work best? Where should the labels be placed and how could they be phrased to succinctly convey meaning? Should data points be represented by lines, or bars, or dots, or balloons, or shades of colour? All of these decisions need to made with two things in mind: Rigour, accuracy, legitimacy: the chart needs to be honest. The reader: the chart needs to help the reader understand something, and it must convince them to pay attention. At the margins, sometimes these two ideas can be in conflict. Maybe a 70-word definition in the middle of your chart would improve its technical accuracy, but it could confuse the average reader and reduce the chart’s impact. Similarly, a bar chart is often the safest way to display data. Like our prose, our charts need to be designed for an interested teenager. But we need to earn their interest. If your reader has seen four similar bar charts in a row and has stopped paying attention by the fifth, your point loses its punch.4 The way we design charts – much like our writing – should always be honest, clear and engaging to the reader. This chapter shows how you can do this with R. It starts with the ‘grammar of graphics’ concepts of a package called ggplot, and explains how to make those charts ‘Grattan-y’. The next chapter gives you the when-to-use and how-to-make particular charts. 4.2 Set-up and packages This section uses the package ggplot2 to visualise data, and dplyr functions to manipulate data. Both of these packages are loaded with tidyverse. The scales package helps with labelling your axes. The grattantheme package is used to make charts look Grattan-y. The absmapsdata package is used to help make maps. library(tidyverse) library(grattantheme) library(ggrepel) library(scales) For most charts in this chapter, we’ll use the sa3_income data summarised below.5 It is a long dataset containing the median income and number of workers by SA3, occupation and sex between 2010 and 2015. We will also create a professionals subset that only includes people in professional occupations in 2015: sa3_income &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/sa3_income.csv&quot;) professionals &lt;- sa3_income %&gt;% select(-sa4_name, -gcc_name) %&gt;% filter(year == 2015, occupation == &quot;Professionals&quot;, !is.na(median_income), !sex == &quot;Persons&quot;) # Show the first six rows of the new dataset head(professionals) ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## sa3 sa3_name sa3_sqkm occupation sex year median_income ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 10102 Queanbe… 6511.

Professio… Males 2015 72664 ## # … with 2 more variables: average_income &lt;dbl&gt;, workers &lt;dbl&gt; 4.3 Concepts The ggplot2 package is based on the grammar of graphics. … The main ingredients to a ggplot chart are: Data: what data should be plotted. e.g. data Aesthetics: what variables should be linked to what chart elements. e.g. aes(x = population, y = age) to connect the population variable to the x axis, and the age variable to the y axis. Geoms: how the data should be plotted. e.g. geom_point() will produce a scatter plot, geom_col will produce a column chart, geom_line() will produce a line chart. Each plot you make will be made up of these three elements. The full list of standard geoms is listed in the tidyverse documentation. ggplot also has a ‘cheat sheet’ that contains many of the often-used elements of a plot, which you can download here. For example, you can plot a column chart by passing the sa3_income dataset into ggplot() (“make a chart with this data”). This completes the first step – data – and produces an empty plot: professionals %&gt;% ggplot() Next, set the aes (aesthetics) to x = state (“make the x-axis represent state”), y = pop (“the y-axis should represent population”), and fill = year (“the fill colour represents year”). Now ggplot knows where things should go. If we just plot that, you’ll see that ggplot knows a little bit more about what we’re trying to do. It has the states on the x-axis and range of populations on the y-axis: professionals %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = workers, y = median_income, colour = sex)) Now that ggplot knows where things should go, it needs to how to plot them on the chart. For this we use geoms. Tell ggplot to take the things it knows and plot them as a column chart by using geom_col: professionals %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = workers, y = median_income, colour = sex)) + geom_point() Great! There are a couple of quick things we can do to make the chart a bit clearer. There are points for each group in each year, which we probably don’t need. So filter the data before you pass it to ggplot to just include 2015: filter(year == 2015). There will still be lots of overlapping points, so set the opacity to below one with alpha = 0.5. The workers x-axis can be changed to a log scale with scale_x_log10. professionals %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = workers, y = median_income, colour = sex)) + geom_point(alpha = .5) + scale_x_log10() That looks a bit better. The following sections in this chapter will cover a broad range of charts and designs, but they will all use the same building-blocks of data, aes, and geom. The rest of the chapter will explore: Exploratory data visualisation Grattanising your charts and choosing colours Saving charts according to Grattan templates Making bar, line, scatter and distribution plots Making maps and interactive charts Adding chart labels 4.4 Exploratory data visualisation Plotting your data early in the analysis stage can help you quickly identify outliers, oddities, things that don’t look quite right. 4.5 Making Grattan-y charts The grattantheme package contains functions that help Grattanise your charts. It is hosted here: https://github.com/mattcowgill/grattantheme You can install it with remotes::install_github from the package: install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;mattcowgill/grattantheme&quot;) The key functions of grattantheme are: theme_grattan: set size, font and colour defaults that adhere to the Grattan style guide. grattan_y_continuous: sets the right defaults for a continuous y-axis. grattan_colour_continuous: pulls colours from the Grattan colour palette for colour aesthetics. grattan_fill_continuous: pulls colours from the Grattan colour palette for fill aesthetics. grattan_save: a save function that exports charts in correct report or presentation dimensions. This section will run through some examples of Grattanising charts. The ggplot functions are explored in more detail in the next section. 4.5.1 Making Grattan charts Start with a scatterplot, similar to the one made above: base_chart &lt;- professionals %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = workers, y = median_income, colour = sex)) + geom_point(alpha = .5) + labs(title = &quot;More professionals, the more they earn&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Median income of professional workers in SA3s&quot;, x = &quot;Number of professional workers&quot;, y = &quot;Median income&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: ABS Estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas, 2011-2016&quot;) base_chart Let’s make it Grattany. First, add theme_grattan to your plot: base_chart + theme_grattan() Then use grattan_y_continuous to adjust the y-axis. This takes the same arguments as the standard scale_y_continuous function, but has Grattan defaults built in. Use it to set the labels as dollars (with scales::dollar()) and to give the y-axis some breathing room (starting at $50,000 rather than the minimum point). Also add scale_x_log10 to make the x-axis a log10 scale, telling it to format the labels as numbers with commas (using scales::comma()).6 base_chart + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = dollar, limits = c(50e3, NA)) + scale_x_log10(labels = comma) To define colour colours, use grattan_colour_manual with the number of colours you need (two, in this case): prof_chart &lt;- base_chart + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = dollar, limits = c(50e3, NA)) + scale_x_log10(labels = comma) + grattan_colour_manual(2) prof_chart Nice chart! Now you can save it and share it with the world. 4.5.2 Saving Grattan charts The grattan_save function saves your charts according to Grattan templates. It takes these arguments: filename: the path, name and file-type of your saved chart. eg: &quot;atlas/professionals_chart.pdf&quot;. object: the R object that you want to save. eg: prof_chart. If left blank, it grabs the last chart that was displayed. type: the Grattan template to be used. This is one of: &quot;normal&quot; The default. Use for normal Grattan report charts, or to paste into a 4:3 PowerPoint slide. Width: 22.2cm, height: 14.5cm. &quot;normal_169&quot; Only useful for pasting into a 16:9 format Grattan PowerPoint slide. Width: 30cm, height: 14.5cm. &quot;tiny&quot; Fills the width of a column in a Grattan report, but is shorter than usual. Width: 22.2cm, height: 11.1cm. &quot;wholecolumn&quot; Takes up a whole column in a Grattan report. Width: 22.2cm, height: 22.2cm. &quot;fullpage&quot; Fills a whole page of a Grattan report. Width: 44.3cm, height: 22.2cm. &quot;fullslide&quot; Creates an image that looks like a 4:3 Grattan PowerPoint slide, complete with logo. Width: 25.4cm, height: 19.0cm. &quot;fullslide_169&quot; Creates` an image that looks like a 16:9 Grattan PowerPoint slide, complete with logo. Use this to drop into standard presentations. Width: 33.9cm, height: 19.0cm &quot;blog&quot; Creates a 4:3 image that looks like a Grattan PowerPoint slide, but with less border whitespace than ‘fullslide’.&quot; &quot;fullslide_44&quot; Creates an image that looks like a 4:4 Grattan PowerPoint slide. This may be useful for taller charts for the Grattan blog; not useful for any other purpose. Width: 25.4cm, height: 25.4cm. Set type = &quot;all&quot; to save your chart in all available sizes. height: override the height set by type. This can be useful for really long charts in blogposts. save_data: exports a csv file containing the data used in the chart. force_labs: override the removal of labels for a particular type. eg force_labs = TRUE will keep the y-axis label. To save the prof_chart plot created above as a whole-column chart for a report: grattan_save(&quot;atlas/professionals_chart_report.pdf&quot;, prof_chart, type = &quot;wholecolumn&quot;) To save it as a presentation slide instead, use type = &quot;fullslide&quot;: grattan_save(&quot;atlas/professionals_chart_presentation.pdf&quot;, prof_chart, type = &quot;fullslide&quot;) Or, if you want to emphasise the point in a really tall chart for a blogpost, you can use type = &quot;blog&quot; and adjust the height to be 50cm. Also note that because this is for the blog, you should save it as a png file: grattan_save(&quot;atlas/professionals_chart_blog.png&quot;, prof_chart, type = &quot;blog&quot;, height = 30) And that’s it! The following sections will go into more detail about different chart types in R, but you’ll mostly use the same basic grattantheme formatting you’ve used here. 4.6 Adding labels Labels can be a bit finicky – especially compared to labelling charts visually in PowerPoint. … Labels can be done in two broad ways: Labelling every single data point on your chart. Grattan charts rarely do this. Labelling some of the data points on your chart. This is how you label Grattan charts: label on item in a group and let the reader join the dots. We’ll look at the first approach so you can get a feel for how the labelling geoms – geom_label and geom_text (and some useful extensions) – work. It won’t be pretty. prof_chart + geom_text(aes(label = sex)) Great! That looks terrible. geom_text is labelling each individual point because it has been told to do so. Just like geom_point, it takes the x and y aesthetics of each observation, then plots the label at that location. But we just want to label one of the points for female and one for male. To do this, we can create a new dataset that just contains one observation each. Here, you’re filtering the dataset to include only the female/male observations that have the most people: label_data &lt;- professionals %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% filter(workers == max(workers)) %&gt;% ungroup() label_data ## # A tibble: 2 x 9 ## sa3 sa3_name sa3_sqkm occupation sex year median_income ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 11703 Sydney … 25.1 Professio… Fema… 2015 74684 ## 2 11703 Sydney … 25.1 Professio… Males 2015 90502 ## # … with 2 more variables: average_income &lt;dbl&gt;, workers &lt;dbl&gt; And then tell geom_text to look at that dataset: prof_chart + geom_text(data = label_data, aes(label = sex)) Okay, not bad. The labels go off the chart. You could fix this by shortening the labels either inside the label_data: label_data_short &lt;- label_data %&gt;% mutate(sex_label = if_else(sex == &quot;Females&quot;, &quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;)) prof_chart + geom_text(data = label_data_short, aes(label = sex_label)) Or you could adjust the label values directly inside the aesthetics call. Note that this means you have to provide a vector that is the same length as the number of observations in the data (a length of two, in this case). prof_chart + geom_text(data = label_data, aes(label = c(&quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;))) To have more freedom over where your labels are placed, you can create a dataset yourself. Add the x and y values for your labels, and the label names.7 self_label &lt;- tribble( ~sex, ~sex_label, ~workers, ~median_income, &quot;Females&quot;, &quot;Women&quot;, 23000, 55000, &quot;Males&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;, 23000, 110000) self_label ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## sex sex_label workers median_income ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Females Women 23000 55000 ## 2 Males Men 23000 110000 prof_chart + geom_text(data = self_label, aes(label = sex_label), hjust = 1) From Kieran Healy’s Data Vizualization: A Practical Introduction: ‘You should look at your data. Graphs and charts let you explore and learn about the structure of the information you collect. Good data visualizations also make it easier to communicate your ideas and findings to other people.’↩ ‘Bar charts are evidence that you are dead inside’ – Amanda Cox, data editor for the New York Times.↩ From ABS Employee income by occupation and sex, 2010-11 to 2015-16↩ The dollar and comma commands are functions, but can be used without (). Using dollar() or comma() works too, and you can provide arguments that adjust their output: eg dollar(suffix = &quot;million&quot;)↩ We are using the tribble function here to make it a little bit clearer what values apply to which sex. The ‘normal’ way to create a tibble is with the tibble function: tibble(x = c(10, 100), y = c(100, 10)), etc.↩ "],

Creating a bar chart will look something like this: ggplot(data = &lt;data&gt;) + geom_bar(aes(x = &lt;xvar&gt;, y = &lt;yvar&gt;), stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, position = &lt;POSITION&gt; ) It has two key arguments: stat and position. First, stat defines what kind of operation the function will do on the dataset before plotting. Some options are: &quot;count&quot;, the default: count the number of observations in a particular group, and plot that number. This is useful when you’re using microdata. When this is the case, there is no need for a y aesthetic. &quot;sum&quot;: sum the values of the y aesthetic. &quot;identity&quot;: directly report the values of the y aesthetic. This is how PowerPoint and Excel charts work. You can use geom_col instead, as a shortcut for geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity). Second, position, dictates how multiple bars occupying the same x-axis position will positioned. The options are: &quot;stack&quot;, the default: bars in the same group are stacked atop one another. &quot;dodge&quot;: bars in the same group are positioned next to one another. &quot;fill&quot;: bars in the same group are stacked and all fill to 100 per cent. Let’s look at a bar chart that shows the proportion of areas where people earn less than $50,000 in each occupation type: data &lt;- sa3_income %&gt;% filter(!sex == &quot;Persons&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(under = average_income &lt; 60e3) %&gt;% group_by(occupation, sex, under) %&gt;% summarise(n = sum(workers)) %&gt;% mutate(pc = n / sum(n)) %&gt;% filter(under == FALSE) data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = occupation, y = pc * 100, fill = sex)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_grattan() + grattan_y_continuous(labels = comma) + grattan_fill_manual(6) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) + coord_flip() You can also order the groups in your chart by a variable. If you want to order states by population, use reorder inside aes: To flip the chart – a useful move when you have long labels – add coord_flipped (ie ‘flip coordinates’) and tell theme_grattan that the plot is flipped using flipped = TRUE. Our long numeric labels means the chart clips them off a bit at the end. We can deal with this in two ways: Adjust the limits of the axis to accommodate the long labels, meaning we will have to define our own axis-label breaks using the seq function9: Add empty space at the top of the chart to accommodate the long labels: 6.2 Line charts A line chart has one key aesthetic: group. This tells ggplot how to connect individual lines. You can also add dots for each year by layering geom_point on top of geom_line: If you wanted to show each state individually, you could facet your chart so that a separate plot was produced for each state: To tidy this up, we can: shorten the years to be “13”, “14”, etc instead of “2013”, “2014”, etc (via the x aesthetic) shorten the y-axis labels to “millions” (via the y aesthetic) add a black horizontal line at the bottom of each facet give the facets a bit of room by adjusting panel.spacing define our own x-axis label breaks to just show 13, 15 and 17 6.3 Scatter plots Scatter plots require x and y aesthetics. These can then be coloured and faceted. First, create a dataset that we’ll use for scatter plots. Take the population_table dataset and transform it to have one variable for population in 2013, and another for population in 2018: Then plot it It looks like the areas with the largest population grew the most between 2013 and 2018. To explore the relationship further, you can add a line-of-best-fit with geom_smooth: You could colour-code positive and negative changes from within the geom_point aesthetic. Making a change there won’t pass through to the geom_smooth aesthetic, so your line-of-best-fit will apply to all data points. Like the charts above, you could facet this by state to see if there were any interesting patterns. We’ll filter out ACT and NT because they only have one and two data points (SA4s) in them, respectively. 6.4 Distributions geom_histogram geom_density ggridges:: 6.5 Maps 6.5.1 sf objects [what is] 6.5.2 Using absmapsdata The absmapsdata contains compressed, and tidied sf objects containing geometric information about ABS data structures. The included objects are: Statistical Area 1 2011 and 2016: sa12011 or sa12016 Statistical Area 2 2011 and 2016: sa22011 or sa22016 Statistical Area 3 2011 and 2016: sa32011 or sa32016 Statistical Area 4 2011 and 2016: sa42011 or sa42016 Greater Capital Cities 2011 and 2016: gcc2011 or gcc2016 Remoteness Areas 2011 and 2016: ra2011 or ra2016 State 2011 and 2016: state2011 or state2016 Commonwealth Electoral Divisions 2018: ced2018 State Electoral Divisions 2018:sed2018 Local Government Areas 2016 and 2018: lga2016 or lga2018 Postcodes 2016: postcodes2016 You can install the package from Github: remotes::install_github(&quot;wfmackey/absmapsdata&quot;) library(absmapsdata) You will also need the sf package installed to handle the sf objects: install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) library(sf) 6.5.3 Making choropleth maps Choropleth maps break an area into ‘bits’, and colours each ‘bit’ according to a variable. SA4 is the largest non-state statistical area in the ABS ASGS standard. You can join the sf objects from absmapsdata to your dataset using left_join. The variable names might be different – eg sa4_name compared to sa4_name_2016 – so use the by function to match them. You then plot a map like you would any other ggplot: provide your data, then choose your aes and your geom. For maps with sf objects, the key aesthetic is geometry = geometry, and the key geom is geom_sf. The argument lwd controls the line width of area borders. Note that RStudio takes a long time to render a map in the Showing all of Australia on a single map is difficult: there are enormous areas that are home to few people which dominate the space. Showing individual states or capital city areas can sometimes be useful. To do this, filter the map_data object: 6.5.3.1 Adding labels to maps You can add labels to choropleth maps with the standard geom_text or geom_label. Because it is likely that some labels will overlap, ggrepel::geom_text_repel or ggrepel::geom_label_repel is usually the better option. To use geom_(text|label)_repel, you need to tell ggrepel where in map &lt;- map_data %&gt;% filter(state == &quot;Vic&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(geometry = geometry)) + geom_sf(aes(fill = pop_change), lwd = .1, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + theme_void() + grattan_fill_manual(discrete = FALSE, palette = &quot;diverging&quot;, limits = c(-20, 20), breaks = seq(-20, 20, 10)) + geom_label_repel(aes(label = sa4_name), stat = &quot;sf_coordinates&quot;, nudge_x = 1000, segment.alpha = .5, size = 4, direction = &quot;y&quot;, label.size = 0, label.padding = unit(0.1, &quot;lines&quot;), colour = &quot;grey50&quot;, segment.color = &quot;grey50&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, .2))) + theme(legend.position = &quot;top&quot;) + labs(fill = &quot;Population \\nchange&quot;) map 6.6 Creating simple interactive graphs with plotly plotly::ggplotly() From ABS Employee income by occupation and sex, 2010-11 to 2015-16↩ seq(x1, x2, y) will return a vector of numbers between x1 and x2, spaced by y.
